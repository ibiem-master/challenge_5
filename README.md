2. Fill the blank R code chunks and write text outside of chunks where indicated in [challenge5_assignment.Rmd](challenge5_assignment.Rmd)

3. Modify the header of [challenge5_assignment.Rmd](challenge5_assignment.Rmd) (you might want to review the [relevant instructions from Challenge 1](https://github.com/IBIEM/challenge_1/blob/master/README.Rmd#modify-the-header)

4. Submit the Assignment (you might want to review the [relevant instructions from Challenge 1](https://github.com/IBIEM/challenge_1/blob/master/README.Rmd#submitting-the-assignment) ).  You should submit the following:

## Grading
For this assignment and future assignments we will be checking for:

| Weight (%) | Component                  |
|------------|----------------------------|
|         70 | Correct Result             |
|         15 | Code Quality               |
|         10 | Git Commit Message Quality |
|          5 | SessionInfo                |


### Git Commit Message Quality
  - For some helpful hints [search the internet for "writing good commit messages"](https://duckduckgo.com/?q=writing+good+commit+messages)
  - You may also want [examples of what not to do](https://xkcd.com/1296/)

### SessionInfo
Including a `SessionInfo` statement at the end of your R Notebook is good reproducibility practice.
